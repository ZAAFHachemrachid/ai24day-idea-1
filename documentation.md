## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **Main Application (`main.py`)**
   - Entry point for the application
   - Initializes the GUI and core components

2. **User Interface (`ui/`)**
   - `main_window.py`: Main application window
   - `widgets.py`: Custom UI components
   - `dialogs.py`: Registration and viewer dialogs
3. **Face Recognition (`face_recognition/`)**
   - `recognition.py`: Core recognition logic with enhanced distance-aware recognition
   - `initializers.py`: Setup for face detection models
   - Uses InsightFace for accurate face detection and recognition
   - Multi-scale recognition with optimized similarity calculations
   - Facial landmark detection for eyes and mouth tracking
   - Enhanced recognition features:
     * Distance-aware similarity weighting
     * Multi-scale embedding comparison
     * Early return for high-confidence matches
     * Normalized embedding comparisons
     * Configurable recognition thresholds

4. **Tracking System (`tracking/`)**
   - `tracker.py`: Advanced face tracking implementation
   - Optimizes performance through:
     * Adaptive detection intervals
     * Size-based face filtering
     * Frame preprocessing and scaling
     * Continuous tracking between detections
     * Automatic tracker reinitialization
   - Smart tracking features:
     * Face ID generation for consistent tracking
     * Last seen frame tracking
     * Original coordinate scaling
     * Configurable tracking parameters
     * Visual tracking feedback


5. **Attendance System (`attendance/`)**
   - `logger.py`: Attendance logging and management
   - Tracks present/away status
   - Generates attendance reports

### Database Architecture

The system uses SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM, consisting of the following models:

1. **User**
   - Basic user information
   - Links to face samples and recognition events

2. **FaceSample**
   - Stored face samples for recognition
   - Links to associated users

3. **Place**
   - Location tracking for recognition events
   - Supports multi-location deployment

4. **RecognitionEvent**
   - Records of face recognition occurrences
   - Includes confidence scores and timestamps
5. **Attendance System**
   - Daily attendance records
   - Tracks check-in/out times and duration
   - Real-time presence monitoring
   - Automatic attendance logging features:
     * CSV-based attendance logs
     * Timestamp-based presence tracking
     * Configurable away threshold (default 30 seconds)
     * Automatic departure logging
     * Continuous presence status updates

## Usage Guide

### 1. Starting the Application
- Run `main.py` to launch the application
- The system automatically initializes the camera and face recognition models

### 2. User Registration
- Click the "Register" button in the control panel
- Capture face samples for the new user
- Enter user information in the registration dialog

### 3. Attendance Monitoring
- The system automatically detects and recognizes faces
- Present users are tracked in real-time
- Away status is updated after 30 seconds of absence
- Attendance Log Features:
  * Automatic CSV file creation and management
  * Real-time arrival and departure logging
  * Persistent attendance history
  * Continuous presence tracking
  * Smart status updates for temporary absences
  * Multiple person tracking simultaneously
  * Automatic log file initialization

### 4. Viewing Records
- Use "View Logs" to check attendance records
- "View Faces" shows registered user face samples
- Performance statistics are displayed in real-time

### 5. Facial Feature Detection
- Enable/disable eye and mouth detection
- Choose detection highlight colors
- Adjust detection parameters as needed
- Precise facial landmark detection:
  * Automatic eye region detection (30x20 pixel regions)
  * Dynamic mouth region calculation based on mouth corners
  * Proportional sizing for facial features
  * Real-time feature tracking and visualization
