# Installation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the automated installation process for the Face Recognition Attendance System.

## Installation Script Requirements

The installation script will need to perform the following tasks:

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Clone the repository from https://github.com/ZAAFHachemrachid/ai24day-idea-1
   - Navigate to the project directory

2. **Python Environment Setup**
   - Create a Python virtual environment
   - Activate the virtual environment
   - Error handling for Python version compatibility

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Install required packages from requirements.txt:
     - numpy>=1.19.0
     - opencv-python>=4.5.0
     - filterpy>=1.4.5
     - psutil>=5.9.0
     - pytest>=7.0.0
   - Install the package in editable mode using `pip install -e .`

4. **Initial Configuration**
   - Ensure required directories exist
   - Set up database
   - Initialize face recognition models

5. **Verification Steps**
   - Verify Python environment
   - Check all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Validate database initialization
   - Test basic functionality

## Script Implementation Plan

```bash
# Pseudo-code structure for install.sh
1. Set error handling
2. Define color outputs for better user feedback
3. Check Python version
4. Clone repository
5. Create and activate virtual environment
6. Install dependencies
7. Run initial setup
8. Verify installation
```

## Running the Application

After installation is complete:
1. Activate the virtual environment
2. Run `python src/main.py`

## Troubleshooting

Common issues to handle:
- Python version mismatch
- Missing system dependencies
- Network connectivity issues during clone/install
- Permission issues
- Virtual environment creation failures

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement the actual installation script
2. Test the installation process on a clean environment
3. Document any additional requirements or dependencies discovered during testing
