```

### Hardware-Optimized Improvements:

1. **Smart Frame Buffering**

- Add frame quality assessment using AVX2/AVX512 optimized operations
- Buffer size tuned to L3 cache size (8MB) for optimal performance
- Utilize hardware-accelerated frame processing where available

2. **Enhanced Memory Utilization**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        # CPU optimization
        self.num_workers = 3  # Leave 1 core for UI/other tasks
        self.cpu_threshold = 0.7  # 70% CPU usage target
        
        # Memory optimization (32GB RAM available)
        self.frame_buffer_size = 1024  # Store more frames in memory
        self.batch_size = 16  # Larger batch processing
        self.frame_buffer = []
        self.embedding_cache_size = 10000  # Cache more face embeddings
        
        # Advanced memory features
        self.preload_models = True  # Keep models in RAM
        self.enable_frame_prefetch = True  # Prefetch next batch
        self.memory_pressure_threshold = 0.8  # 80% RAM usage
```

3. **Memory-Optimized Features**

2. **Frame Data Lifecycle**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_pool = []
        self.max_queue_size = 30
        self.gc_threshold = 0.8  # 80% memory usage
```

## 3. Performance Monitoring Enhancements

### New Metrics to Track:
1. Memory usage per frame
2. Queue wait times
3. Frame drop rate
4. Cache hit rates

```

## 4. CPU-Optimized Threading Model

- Primary detection pool: 3 worker threads on physical cores
- Recognition pool: 2 worker threads (sharing cores with detection)
- UI thread: Dedicated single core for responsiveness
- Background tasks: Utilize remaining logical cores

2. **Load Balancing and Thermal Management**
```python
class AdaptiveWorkerPool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.physical_cores = 4
        self.logical_cores = 8
        self.max_freq = 4200  # MHz
        self.min_freq = 400   # MHz
        self.thermal_threshold = 85  # Celsius
        
    def adjust_workers(self, load_factor, temp):
        if temp > self.thermal_threshold:
            return self.throttled_config()
            
        return min(
            3,  # Max workers for detection
            int(self.physical_cores * load_factor)
        )
        
    def optimize_thread_affinity(self):
        # Pin detection threads to physical cores 0-2
        # Pin UI thread to physical core 3
        # Let recognition threads float on logical cores
        pass
```

3. **CPU Feature Utilization**
- AVX512 optimization for matrix operations
- Hardware-accelerated video decode/encode
- SIMD instructions for parallel processing
- Enhanced frequency scaling based on workload

## 5. Caching Strategy

1. **Multi-level Cache**

- L2: Persistent storage for frequent faces
- Implement LRU eviction policy

```python
class RecognitionCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.l1_cache = LRUCache(100)  # Recent faces
        self.l2_cache = PersistentCache()
        self.hit_counter = Counter()
```
